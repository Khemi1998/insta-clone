This project is was a challenge that was completed in less than 12 hours. The user can change to different profiles. The data is stored in data.js.
Further improvements would include altering the code so that the app replies more heavily on the data. Poteintually remove the manual creation of the profile containers and add mapping to the routing in app.js
